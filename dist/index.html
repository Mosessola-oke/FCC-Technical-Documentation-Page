        <p>C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure
          and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. The .NET ecosystem is composed of all the
          implementations of .NET, including both but not limited to .NET Core, and .NET Framework. This article focuses
          on .NET Framework. You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed
          components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more.</p>
        <p>As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All
          variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class
          definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of
          interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to
          avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that
          can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.</p>
        <p>In addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# makes it easy to develop software components
          through several innovative language constructs, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.</li>
          <li>Properties, which serve as accessors for private member variables.</li>
          <li>Attributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time.</li>
          <li>Inline XML documentation comments.</li>
          <li>Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which provides built-in query capabilities across a variety of data
            sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>C# programs run on the .NET Framework, an integral component of Windows that includes a virtual execution
          system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified set of class libraries. The CLR is the
          commercial implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard
          that is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work
          together seamlessly.</p>
        <p>Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI
          specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored on disk in an executable
          file called an assembly, typically with an extension of .exe or .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that
          provides information about the assembly's types, version, culture, and security requirements.</p>
        <p>In addition to the run time services, the .NET Framework also includes an extensive library of over 4000
          classes organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful functionality for everything from file
          input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application
          uses the .NET Framework class library extensively to handle common "plumbing" chores.</p>

        <p>Run the following code in the interactive window. Select the Enter focus mode button. Then, type the
          following code block in the interactive window and select Run:</p>
        <code>
          Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">"Hello World!"</span>);
        </code>
        <p>Congratulations! You've run your first C# program. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello
          World!". It used the Console.WriteLine method to print that message. Console is a type that represents the
          console window. WriteLine is a method of the Console type that prints a line of text to that text console.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Your first program printed the string "Hello World!" on the screen.</p>
        <p>Your first program is limited to printing one message. You can write more useful programs by using variables.
          A variable is a symbol you can use to run the same code with different values. Let's try it! Replace the code
          you've written in the interactive window with the following code:</p>
        <code><span class="blue">string</span>  aFriend = <span class="orange">"Bill"</span>; <br>
          Console.WriteLine(aFriend);</code>
        <p>The first line declares a variable, aFriend and assigns it a value, "Bill". The second line prints out the
          name.</p>
        <p>The first line declares a variable, aFriend and assigns it a value, "Bill". The second line prints out the
          name.</p>
        <code>aFriend = <span class="orange">"Maira"</span>; <br>
          Console.WriteLine(aFriend);</code>
        <p>Notice that the same line of code prints two different messages, based on the value stored in the aFriend
          variable.</p>
        <p>You may have also noticed that the word "Hello" was missing in the last two messages. Let's fix that now.
          Modify the lines that print the message to the following:</p>
        <code>Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">"Hello"</span> + aFriend);</code>
        <p>Select Run again to see the results.Select Run again to see the results.</p>
        <p>You've been using + to build strings from variables and constant strings. There's a better way. You can place
          a variable between { and } characters to tell C# to replace that text with the value of the variable.</p>
        <p>This is called String interpolation.</p>
        <p>If you add a $ before the opening quote of the string, you can then include variables, like aFriend, inside
          the string between curly braces. Give it a try:</p>
        <code>Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">$"Hello </span>{aFriend}<span class="orange">"</span>);</code>
        <p>Select Run again to see the results. Instead of "Hello {aFriend}", the message should be "Hello Maira".</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Work_with_strings">
      <header>Work with strings</header>
      <article>
        <p>Your last edit was our first look at what you can do with strings. Let's explore more.</p>
        <p>You're not limited to a single variable between the curly braces. Try this:</p>
        <code><span class="blue">string</span> firstFriend = <span class="orange">"Maira"</span>; <br>
          <span class="blue">string</span> secondFriend = <span class="orange">"Sage"</span>; <br>
          Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">$"My friends are</span> {firstFriend} <span class="orange">and</span> {secondFriend}<span class="orange">"</span>);</code>
        <p>As you explore more with strings, you'll find that strings are more than a collection of letters. You can
          find the length of a string using Length. Length is a property of a string and it returns the number of
          characters in that string. Add the following code at the bottom of the interactive window:</p>
          <code>Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">$"The name</span> {firstFriend} <span class="orange">has</span> {firstFriend.Length} <span class="orange">letters."</span>); <br>
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="orange">$"The name</span> {secondFriend} <span class="orange">has</span> {secondFriend.Length} <span class="orange">letters."</span>);</code>

      <article>
        <p>C# is a strongly typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. The .NET Framework class library defines a set of built-in numeric types as well as more complex types that represent a wide variety of logical constructs, such as the file system, network connections, collections and arrays of objects, and dates. A typical C# program uses types from the class library as well as user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.</p>
        <p>The information stored in a type can include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The storage space that a variable of the type requires.</li>
          <li>The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.</li>
          <li>The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.</li>
          <li>The base type it inherits from.</li>
          <li>The location where the memory for variables will be allocated at run time.</li>
          <li>The kinds of operations that are permitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The compiler uses type information to make sure that all operations that are performed in your code are type safe. For example, if you declare a variable of type int, the compiler allows you to use the variable in addition and subtraction operations. If you try to perform those same operations on a variable of type bool, the compiler generates an error, as shown in the following example:</p>
        <code> <span class="blue">int</span> a = 5; <br>
          <span class="blue">int</span> b = a + 2; <span class="green">//OK</span> <br>
          
          <span class="blue">bool</span>  test = <span class="blue">true</span> ; <br>
          
          <span class="green">// Error. Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'. </span> <br>
          <span class="blue">int</span> c = a + test;</code>
          <p>The compiler embeds the type information into the executable file as metadata. The common language runtime (CLR) uses that metadata at run time to further guarantee type safety when it allocates and reclaims memory.</p>
